The Ministry for the Future is a decent book exploring a relatively optimistic future where we as a species 
are able to adapt to climate change without significantly disrupting modern civilisation. It explores a 
scenario where the UN, in symbiosis with increasingly militant eco-terrorist, is able to enact policy that 
significantly curtails both state and capital in such a way that it can ensure a relatively smooth transition 
to a sustainable post-capitalist future.

As for the story, parts are well written and most of the characters 
are at least somewhat engaging. At the same time, it is clear that the characters are mere devices for the 
utopian speculations and subordinated to the “idea” of the book. The book thus remains trapped within its 
genre as a “novel of ideas” where more general literary qualities are secondary to the “point”: that an 
ecological non-capitalist modernity is possible.

While the lacklustre literary qualities lower my overall 
impressions with the book they could be forgiven if the point was more convincing.  My main critique of the 
book is that it is both too utopian and to trapped within what I, with Mark Fishers overused term, would call 
“capitalist realism”. It’s limits as a utopia is that institutes such as the state and the value-form remain 
post capitalism, it is unable to portray a future where such heteronomous institutions can be completely 
overcome. Furthermore, it is utopian in the sense that anthropogenic climate change can be overcome smoothy 
through largely technocratic means, while at the same time catering to some form of increased 
democratisation. 

While this review has been largely negative, I would still argue that the book is well worth 
the read. In my case not as inspiration, rather the opposite, as an exploration of the limits of modern 
civilisation and how it despite the authors intent still appears as a world that still limits human autonomy 
and a complete sublation, the magical word aufhebung comes to my mind, of the nature-culture divide.
